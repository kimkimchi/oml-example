# Homework

- Create a new description project to model your own mission/system using the same example vocabularies (or a variation of it)

  Remember: If you chose to change the vocabularies, remember to publish it to Maven Local before using it in your descriptions

- In the course of your development, frequently build the prject to check that your model is consistent.

- Develop a set of SPARQL queries to extract useful data frames from your dataset

- Create a small presentation that describes your model organization, your chosen data frames, and reflect on the experience 

  Remember: add tables to show a sample of your query results
